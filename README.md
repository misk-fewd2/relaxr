# FEWD Week #3: CSS Layouts - Relaxr


<br>


### Description 


A hot, new NY Tech Startup, Relaxr, has approached you to help them develop a new landing page for their company. They've handed you the [design file](./starter-code/design_file.txt) for the site, along with the copy and assets. 

Starting in class, you will work to build out a more complex layout for their company site. They decided on creating a blog, and their back-end engineers will be focused on developing the blog's functionality. They want your front-end skills to style their designs using HTML and CSS so Relaxr's engineers can begin integrating. 

The designers have handed you a basic [design file with instructions](./starter-code/design_file.txt) and the JPEG below to help you bring the blog to life. Submit the finished version for homework.
